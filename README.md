LlamaIndex Chatbot for Topic-Specific and Mathematical Queries
Overview
This project involves the development of an intelligent chatbot using LlamaIndex, designed to assist users by answering queries related to specific topics provided through documents. Additionally, the chatbot is capable of solving mathematical questions pertinent to these topics. This solution is ideal for companies looking to provide a responsive and informative digital assistant on their website.

Key Features
Topic-Specific Query Handling: The chatbot is trained on specific documents provided by the company, enabling it to answer questions accurately and contextually based on the content of these documents.
Mathematical Query Resolution: Beyond textual information, the chatbot can handle and solve mathematical problems related to the topics it covers, offering a well-rounded user experience.
Seamless Integration with Websites: The chatbot can be easily embedded into your company's website, providing real-time assistance to visitors.
Powered by LlamaIndex: Utilizing LlamaIndex allows the chatbot to efficiently index and query large volumes of data, ensuring quick and relevant responses.
Installation

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/llamaindex-chatbot.git
cd llamaindex-chatbot
Install Dependencies Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.8 or higher). Then, install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Load the Documents Place the documents containing the topics the chatbot will cover into the data/documents/ directory. The chatbot will use these documents to build its knowledge base.

Run the Application Start the chatbot server by running:

python main.py
Integration with FastAPI (Optional) If you wish to deploy the chatbot as part of a FastAPI application, follow these additional steps:

Install FastAPI:
pip install fastapi
Modify the main.py file to include FastAPI routes for the chatbot.
Usage
Once the chatbot is running, visitors to your website can interact with it by asking questions related to the topics you've provided. The chatbot will retrieve information from the indexed documents and provide accurate responses. It will also handle mathematical queries efficiently, leveraging LlamaIndex's capabilities.

Customization
Document Updates: To update the topics, simply replace or add new documents in the data/documents/ directory and restart the application.
Mathematical Query Handling: Customize the mathematical problem-solving capabilities by extending the relevant functions in the math_solver.py module.
